# ML–LLM Refresh

#### Just a little ML practice before I dive deep into Andrej Karpathy's "Build GPT" series.

This repo is my personal refresher to:
- Revisit the **core ML concepts** step-by-step.
- Build intuition with **from-scratch implementations** (NumPy first, then frameworks).
- Warm up for deeper dives into **transformers, attention, and LLM training**.

## **Structure**
- `notebooks/` — interactive Jupyter notebooks for experiments  
- `notes/` — quick references and cheat sheets  
- `src/` — helper scripts and reusable code  
- `requirements.txt` — Python dependencies
